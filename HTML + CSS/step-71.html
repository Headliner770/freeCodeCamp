<!doctype html>

Step 71
You can set browser behavior by adding meta elements in the head. Here's an example:

Example Code
<meta attribute="value">
Inside the head element, nest a meta element with an attribute named charset. Set to the value to utf-8 which tells the
browser how to encode characters for the page.

Note that the meta element is a void element.

With that last change, you have completed the Cat Photo App project. Congratulations!
