<!-- Step 17
In previous steps you used an anchor element to turn text into a link. Other types of content can also be turned into a link by wrapping it in anchor tags.

Here is an example of turning an image into a link:

Example Code
<a href="example-link">
  <img src="image-link.jpg" alt="A photo of a cat.">
</a>
Turn the image into a link by surrounding it with necessary element tags. Use https://freecatphotoapp.com as the anchor's href attribute value. -->
