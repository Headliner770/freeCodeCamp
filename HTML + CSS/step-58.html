Step 58
There's another way to associate an input element's text with the element itself. You can nest the text within a label
element and add a for attribute with the same value as the input element's id attribute.

Given an input element as below:

Example Code
<input id="breakfast" type="radio" name="meal" value="breakfast">
An example of a label element that is associated to this input element is:

Example Code
<label for="breakfast">Breakfast</label>
Associate the text Loving with the checkbox by nesting only the text Loving in a label element and giving it an
appropriate for attribute.

<!-- //  ✔️ SOLUTION   -->
<input id="loving" type="checkbox">
<label for="loving">Loving</label>
