Step 63
In order to make a checkbox checked or radio button selected by default, you need to add the checked attribute to it.

Here is an example of a radio button with the checked attribute:

Example Code
<input checked type="radio" name="meal" value="breakfast"> Breakfast
There's no need to set a value to the checked attribute. Instead, just add the word checked to the input element, making
sure there is space between it and other attributes.

Make the first radio button and the first checkbox selected by default.
