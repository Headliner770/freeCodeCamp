<!doctype html>

Step 43
To prevent a user from submitting your form when required information is missing, you need to add the required attribute
to an input element.

Here is an example of an input field with the required attribute:

Example Code
<input type="text" name="firstName" required>
There's no need to set a value to the required attribute. Instead, just add the word required to the input element,
making sure there is space between it and other attributes.
